Contribution 
 
As a member of the team, In this project I have written the core code for the seat reservation system, which includes implementing the primary functionalities such as displaying the seating arrangement, handling user inputs for reserving seats, and ensuring proper validation and error handling. I developed the functions to dynamically update seat availability and provide real-time feedback to users, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly booking experience. Additionally, I focused on creating a modular and maintainable code structure that facilitates easy modifications and extensions. My contributions also included thorough testing and debugging to ensure the system operates reliably and efficiently, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience and achieving the project's objectives.
